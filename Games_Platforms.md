## Notes

### Arcade Games

Classic arcade games, of the type found in the late seventies' and eighties' arcade cabinets, home video game consoles and home computers.

- Atari 2600: Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)
  - ALE is built on top of the Atari 2600 emulator Stella and contains more than 50 original Atari 2600 games. The framework extracts the game score, 160×210 screen pixels and the RAM content that can be used as input for game playing agents.
- Nintendo NES: Retro Learning Environment (RLE)
  - currently contains seven games released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) . Many of these games have 3D graphics and the controller allows for over 720 action combinations. SNES games are thus more **complex** and **realistic** than Atari 2600 games but RLE has not been as popular as ALE.
- Commodore 64
- ZX Spectrum

In this category of games, it hugely relies on the graphic logics, such as reflecting the ball using a bar(Breakout). Most games require fast reactions and precise timing, and a few games, in particular, early sports games such as Track & Field (Konami, 1983) rely almost exclusively on speed and reactions. And another common requirement is navigating mazes or other complex 2D environments, e,g,. Pac-Man (Namco, 1980) and Boulder Dash (First Star Software, 1984). Among these games, some games have outstanding features, such as Montezuma’s Revenge (Parker Brothers, 1984), require long-term planning involving the memorization of temporarily unobservable game states.

### Racing Games

Racing games are games where the player is tasked with controlling some kind of vehicle or character so as to reach a goal in the shortest possible time, or as to traverse as far as possible along a track in a given time. And The vast majority of racing games take a continuous input signal as steering input, similar to a steering wheel. A popular environment for visual reinforcement learning with realistic 3D graphics is the open racing car simulator TORCS.

### First-Person Shooters (FPS)
