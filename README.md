## Introduction

This is the repo for storing the reviewing note regarding to several domains in *reinforcement learning*



* [basic_reinforcement_learning](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/basic_reinforcement_learning): review for UCL course led by David Silver and the draft of the great textbook of "Reinforcement Learning An Introduction"  wrote by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto
* [deep_reinforcement_learning](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/deep_reinforcement_learning): about deep reinforcement learning(DRL so called)
* [multi_agent_reinforcement_learning_notes](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/multi_agent_reinforcement_learning_notes): about multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL so called)
* [multi_objective_RL](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/multi_objective_RL): about RL algorithms dealing with the case where learning agent has to learn the preferences among the multiple goals in the environment
* [safe_reinforcement_learning](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/safe_reinforcement_learning): about RL algorithms aims the safe exploration during the early stage in learning process.
* [transfer_learning](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/transfer_learning): about the algorithms aims at successfully transferring the knowledge from the source task to the target task to speed-up learning process.
