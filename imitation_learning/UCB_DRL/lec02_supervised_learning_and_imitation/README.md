## Notes ~Supervised Learning of Behaviours~ 

### Definition of sequential decision problems


$$
s_t: \text{state} \\
o_t: \text{observation} \\
a_t: \text{action} \\
\pi_{\theta}(a_t | o_t): \text{policy} \\
\pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t): \text{policy}
$$

### Imitation learning: supervised learning for decision making

#### Does direct imitation work?

##### Drift of distribution

Simple behaviour cloning does not work often. Because of drifting the distribution problem. Once the agent takes a different action than the one of a human driver, it will encounter a new state where the agent would not be able to perform well.

#### How can we make it work more often?

##### DAgger

There some approaches to address this problem, but in this lecture they are discussing the approach called, **DAgger(Dataset Aggregation)**.

##### What can cause the drifting the distribution problem?

1. Non-Markovian Behaviour
   - As a human, we don't react to the same scene as before even though we encountered it twice.
   - So the context is important for sequential decision making.
   - **Typically, LSTM cells work better here**
2. Multimodal Behaviour: Normally human behaviours are not easy to model since it can contain a lot of unreasonable factor in it.

### What is missing from IL

#### Imitation learning: whatâ€™s the problem?

1. Humans need to provide data, which is typically finite
2. Humans are not good at providing some kinds of actions
3. Humans can learn autonomously; can our machines do the same?
