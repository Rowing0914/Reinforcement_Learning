# CS294-112 HW 5a: Exploration

Dependencies:
 * Python **3.5**
 * Numpy version **1.14.5**
 * TensorFlow version **1.10.5**
 * MuJoCo version **1.50** and mujoco-py **1.50.1.56**
 * seaborn
 * tqdm==**4.26.0**

Before doing anything, first replace `gym/envs/mujoco/half_cheetah.py` with the provided `sparse_half_cheetah.py` file. It is always a good idea to keep a copy of the original `gym/envs/mujoco/half_cheetah.py` just in case you need it for something else.

You will implement `density_model.py`, `exploration.py`, and `train_ac_exploration_f18.py`.
