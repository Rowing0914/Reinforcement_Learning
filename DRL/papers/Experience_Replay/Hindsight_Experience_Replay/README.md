Hindsight Experience Replay by M.Andrychowicz et al., NIPS 2017



## Summary

### Problem statement

- Dealing with **sparse rewards** is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL).
- a common challenge, especially for robotics, is the need to engineer a reward function that not only reflects the task at hand but is also carefully shaped to guide the policy optimisation
- RL is still lacking of an ability to reason the cause of failure in a task



### Idea of HER

The pivotal idea behind HER is to replay each episode with a different goal than the one the agent was trying to achieve, e.g. one of the goals which was achieved in the episode.
