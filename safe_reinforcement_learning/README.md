## Introduction
This is the repo for reviewing research papers regarding `Safe Reinforcement Learning`.
As you might know, it is one of the hottest domain in RL, isn't it?
So in this repo, I would like to summarise and post my reviewing notes on this profound topic.

*If you are totally new to this topic, then I recommend you to start with [A Comprehensive Survey on Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/garcia15a/garcia15a.pdf) by Javier Garcia and Fernando Fernandez in 2015*
